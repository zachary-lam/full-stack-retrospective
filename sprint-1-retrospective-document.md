## What went well in the previous sprint?
We were able to collaborate relatively quick and branch ideas off of each other to effectively come up with a project idea. Our interests and ideas seemed to have overlap, so we decided on the Poke ROM Hack Collection with ease.
To ensure it was a measurable goal, we referenced the site [PokeHarbor](https://www.pokeharbor.com/) and it's components, gauging what we could take for inspiration and what we could improve on to make it our own. 
The website and layout is relatively simple, so we determined that we could follow something similar. In order to keep this project relevant, we brainstormed on improvements that we could make from the reference site 
and wrote down the ideas pending for further discussion to assess if they could be doable in later sprints.

## What could have gone better in the previous sprint, or went poorly?
My limited experience with React, particularly JSX {} usage and component nesting rules, contributed to slower task completion and additional debugging time due to React DOM errors (example. a cannot be a directly child of a). 
This impacted overall sprint pace and could pose a risk to future deployment timelines should bugs occur and need to be resolved during development.

To address this, I will proactively reinforce my React fundamentals by reviewing official documentation and possibly tutorial videos and create small test components in a playground-like environment before the next sprint begins, 
allowing me to contribute more efficiently and reduce the likelihood of similar issues recurring.

## What can be done in the next sprint to improve my process?

In the next sprint, I will improve my development process by allocating dedicated extracurrical time outside of the sprint to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals, specifically JSX {} syntax and component composition rules. 
I will also break up my tasks into smaller subtasks so that it's easier for me to follow and understand when coming back to at a later time should it need further refactoring or newly implemented features so that I can get a better grasp at
React.
Additionally, I will spend more time playing around in the lab, creating more components and experimenting with them to see what works and find any gaps in my understanding.
This approach should reduce debugging time, prevent React DOM errors, and help ensure tasks are completed within the sprint timelines.

"I'm not sure about my high-level organizations on the landing page. 
I'd like to review how headers and footers work in relation to the main, and maybe split those out into components. 
For the next sprint review, I want to refactor the headers, footers, and page layout and have my team approve it."

"For this sprint we want to try approving pull requests one at a time into the develop branch, and briefly testing it each time before starting another one. 
That could help with avoiding the bigger merge conflicts. 
For this sprint, I want to test the develop branch each time a new Pull Request has passed for it."

"I found it hard to implement changes from the start and had to refactor a lot of my work once I understood the concepts better. 
For this sprint, I only want to start work on the project after I've implemented a similar solution in my lab first."
